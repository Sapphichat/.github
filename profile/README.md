# Sapphichat

**Sapphichat** is a privacy-first, self-hostable, decentralized messaging app — with no federation, no central servers, and no complex setup.

Designed for simplicity and autonomy, Sapphichat allows anyone to deploy their own server in **one command**, with **zero technical knowledge**. Once deployed, the entire system is managed directly from the iOS client — including configuration, backups, and migrations.

> Yes, the name is a quiet nod. And no, it’s not accidental. 🏳️‍🌈

## ✨ What makes Sapphichat different?

- **Truly decentralized** – No federation, no middlemen. Every server is fully independent.
- **Zero-config deployment** – One command is all it takes to launch your own instance.
- **iOS-first client** – A polished native experience focused on simplicity and speed.
- **No server-side headaches** – After deployment, all backend settings are handled from the app.
- **Automatic backup & restore** – Fully managed through the client.
- **Written in JavaScript** – The backend [sapphichat-backend](https://github.com/Sapphichat/Sapphichat-backend) is lightweight, modern, and easy to extend.
